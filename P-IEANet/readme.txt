Download the IEA data set locally and add the path of the IEA data set to the option.py and dataset.py files.
Then run the python train_wavelet.py file to start training and testing the network, and the parameter file will be saved to the root directory.
In order to test the network's prediction ability on multiple images, run the python make_heatmap.py file, which will read all jpg files in the img_to_pred folder for prediction, and then save the heat map of the prediction results in the img_to_pred folder.
